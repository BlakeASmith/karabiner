# Karabiner Elements Configuration

## Overview

### Launcher Mode

Simultanious `a` + `l` triggers launcher mode

In this mode each key is set to open a specific app.

### Symbols Layer (Hyper + S)

Hold the Hyper modifier (Caps Lock held for Hyper in this setup) and tap `s` to access a symbol layer tuned for programming. While the layer is active:

- `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` send the arrow keys.
- `y`/`u` type `(`/`)`, `i`/`o` type `[`/`]`, and `p`/`[` type `{`/`}`.
- `]` outputs `\` and `\` outputs `|`.
- `;` and `'` send single and double quotes.
- `n`/`m` type `<`/`>`, `,`/`.` type `-`/`=`, `/` types `_`, and `z` types `+`.
- `x`/`c` send `/`/`?`, `q`/`w` send `` ` ``/`~`, and `a`/`s` send `;`/`:`.

The goal is to keep brackets, quotes, math symbols, and arrows on or near the home row.
